# EchoPlay – Personal Music Player
- EchoPlay is a beginner-friendly web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The application allows users to upload and play local audio files, organize songs into a personal music library, and track listening history, including recently played songs and moods.
- Instead of streaming music online, EchoPlay focuses on offline playback and personal music tracking, making it both realistic and student-friendly.
- This project was developed as a student project to practice front-end development, audio handling, local storage, and user interface design.
