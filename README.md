# EchoPlay – Personal Music Player
- EchoPlay is a beginner-friendly, web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- It is designed as a personal offline music player, allowing users to upload and play their own local audio files and manage a simple music library.
- Users can set a local profile name, track recently played songs, and record listening moods, all without accounts or login.
- EchoPlay focuses on offline playback, privacy, and user-owned music, giving users full control over their listening experience.
- This project was developed as a student project to practice front-end development, audio handling, local storage, offline functionality, and user interface design.
